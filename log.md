# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 12, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Colab code for the helloworld TinyML project for Arduino

**Thoughts:**

### Day 1: April 13, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress**: Retrained the helloworld Colab to model a cosine function instead of a sine function. Next steps - dig through the C++ code to use this model instead of the sine function on an Arduino.

**Thoughts:** I learned more about quantization and how it impacts the size of a model. Additionally I learned the steps needed to use with the TensorFlow to convert it to a TensorFlow Lite model for use on microcontrollers.

### Day 2: April 14, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress**: Detour for the day - worked through the Arduino's Gesture TensorFlow lab to train a ML model to detect various gestures.

**Thoughts:** Playing around with the various IDE's for Arduino, I have yet to find a good solution with Intellisense.

### Day 3: April 16, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress:** Working with CLion from Jetbrains to get through the Arduino C code to run my cosine model.

**Thoughts:** Since I am picky about my IDE, I am learning alot about the Arduino ecosystem as well as how the TensorFlow interpreter works on microcontrollers.

### Day 4: April 17, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress:** Spent part of my hour today getting CLion configured and orienting myself with the Arduino development workflow using it. Also contrasted how the TensorFlow project lays out project files to support multiple processors vs how the Arduino team does it.

### Day 5: April 18, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress:** Got CLion setup with PlatformIO so that I can work with all of the Arduino libraries and code in one C++ file. Also got the serial debugger running and started a new project with it all in place.

**Thoughts:** Finally in a place where I can dig into creating and modifying the codebases provided to train a ML model for my purposes.

### Day 6: April 20, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress:** Got my cosine test model to run on the Arduino in CLion. Took a bit of selective copy and paste from the Arduino IDE in CLion as well as some modifications to get it to work with platform.io.

**Thoughts:** CLion and Platform.io seem to integrate well, and the overall workflow is fairly straightforward.
