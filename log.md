# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 12, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Colab code for the helloworld TinyML project for Arduino

**Thoughts:**

### Day 1: April 13, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress**: Retrained the helloworld Colab to model a cosine function instead of a sine function. Next steps - dig through the C++ code to use this model instead of the sine function on an Arduino.

**Thoughts:** I learned more about quantization and how it impacts the size of a model. Additionally I learned the steps needed to use with the TensorFlow to convert it to a TensorFlow Lite model for use on microcontrollers.

### Day 2: April 14, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress**: Detour for the day - worked through the Arduino's Gesture TensorFlow lab to train a ML model to detect various gestures.

**Thoughts:** Playing around with the various IDE's for Arduino, I have yet to find a good solution with Intellisense.

### Day 3: April 16, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress:** Working with CLion from Jetbrains to get through the Arduino C code to run my cosine model.

**Thoughts:** Since I am picky about my IDE, I am learning alot about the Arduino ecosystem as well as how the TensorFlow interpreter works on microcontrollers.
