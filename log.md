# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 12, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Colab code for the helloworld TinyML project for Arduino

**Thoughts:**

### Day 1: April 13, 2020 
##### Learning how to work with TinyML

**Today's Progress**: Retrained the helloworld Colab to model a cosine function instead of a sine function. Next steps - dig through the C++ code to use this model instead of the sine function on an Arduino.

**Thoughts:** I learned more about quantization and how it impacts the size of a model. Additionally I learned the steps needed to use with the TensorFlow to convert it to a TensorFlow Lite model for use on microcontrollers.
